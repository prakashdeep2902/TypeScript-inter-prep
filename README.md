What is TypeScript? How is it different from JavaScript?
"TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It adds robust features like static typing and others, making development easier and enabling better scalability."

Differences between JavaScript and TypeScript:

Static Typing:

In JavaScript, variables are dynamically typed, and the data type is determined at runtime. For example, let or var can hold any data type, which can lead to runtime errors.
In TypeScript, you can define variable types (e.g., string, number, boolean), which ensures type safety at compile time.
Security and Robustness:

TypeScript helps avoid errors by catching them during development (compile-time).
The static type system makes your code more predictable and less prone to runtime bugs.
